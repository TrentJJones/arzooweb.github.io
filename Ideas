/*Idea #1: Scavenger Hunt  
The app would present a map of the zoo when it is opened. The user would then be tasked with going to certain exhibits, where he/she could get information about the animal.
This app could be run on zoo IPads and given to a class of students, or made available for anyone to download.
The information gathered from each exhibit must be used to solve a mystery or some sort of disguised test.*/

/*Idea #2: Natural Behavior
When a sticker or QR code is scanned, a 3D animal of an animal will appear on the screen displaying natural behaviors.
The animal can be rotated on screen.
Animals in zoos often do not display natural behaviors due to being in captivity.
Sometimes, animals hide away from people due to natural shyness or environmental factors, but having a 3D animal would mean people would always be able to learn about them.*/

/*Idea #3: Map
Animated animals guide people to their exhibits.
Animals are projected onto the ground in Augmented Reality.
Complex:
  Animals should walk along the ground as the user moves
  Animal needs to be able to stop before going out of sight, not project through corners, walk at around the same speed as the user
  Requires map implementation, routing programs
  Different animals for each exhibit could cause the difficulty of animation to compound
Would work best to guide the user along a set path, such as a specific tour.
More suitable for a teen or adult audience.*/

/*Idea #4: Animal Information
The app could have information about the different animals featured on the app/in the zoo
It would include information such as diet, behavior, habitat, fun facts
It could also incorporate a voice over that reads out the information
The information could be customized based on the reader, ex: Adult, student, kid.*/
